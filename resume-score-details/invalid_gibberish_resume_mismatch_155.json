        "resume": "Sure, here's a piece of random text:\n\nBob glanced at the peculiar device resting on his workbench. It looked like a contraption from a science fiction movie, with its assortment of blinking lights and faint hum. It was something he had cobbled together over the past few weeks, quite by accident more than design.\n\nFlugelsnoot, his perpetually curious cat, approached the contraption with the kind of curiosity that was both endearing and slightly nerve-wracking. Bob had no idea what this machine did. For all he knew, pressing the big red button might turn Flugelsnoot into a time-traveling kitty. Or maybe nothing would happen at all. Lumping the risk aside, Bob decided it was time to find out.\n\nHe took a deep breath, braced himself for any unexpected warp in the fabric of reality, and pressed the button.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nSlightly disappointed, Bob sighed. But as he was about to turn away, the machine started whirring quietly, and a small door popped open, revealing a steaming mug of perfectly brewed coffee. Bob blinked in disbelief.\n\n\"Oh, this is gonna be big,\" he whispered to Flugelsnoot, who was already perched on the bench, sniffing the aromatic air.\n\nIn unrelated news, a giant inflatable rubber duck was seen floating down the city's river today, providing a whimsical break from the morning commute and leaving thousands of onlookers smiling and snapping photos. No one seems to know how the duck got there, but local authorities are investigating.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the workshop, Bob was already jotting down notes for his next invention: an automatic sandwich assembler. As Flugelsnoot rubbed against his leg, probably in dire need of a snack, Bob couldn't help but grin. Who knew what wonders tomorrow might bring?\n"
