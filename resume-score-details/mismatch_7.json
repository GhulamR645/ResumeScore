That would be 12 scheduled meetings per \nmonth out of which at least 4 should be qualified.  \nBy definition qualified would mean a lead (scheduled meeting)  should fulfil the ANUM criteria.  \nA- Authority, the person should be relevant to the product/service we\u2019re selling. He/she should either be the \ninfluencer or decision maker  \nN- there should be need for what we\u2019re trying to sell  \nU- urgency, should be a defined timeline for the project  \nM- a budget allocated or at least defined for the project.   \n \nAll individuals should be well - versed on  their respective campaigns ( We\u2019ll schedule their training sessions with the \nrelevant presales). They need to make sure to have the right level of knowledge of the product/service to try to \nconvince a prospect for a meeting and/or to prequalify a meeting.   \nEvery lead source needs to be present in their scheduled meeting as a moderator and share the minutes of \nmeetings after every meeting.   \n \nOnce a meeting is scheduled following measures need to be taken:  \n\uf0b7 Timely handover the lead to the concerned sales/pre sa les team including the spec sheet /company details \nand not just the invite. There should be at least a 48 -hour difference before handing over to sales. So if \nyou get connected with some body this week, you try to schedule a slot with them for the following o ne \nand buy some time to get the prequalification details - Exceptions would be entertained either way.   \n\uf0b7 No lead would be forwarded to sales without any prequalification details from the prospect (following the \nprocess that I've shared and/or take internal c alls and then handover).  We'll still consider the exceptions \nin some cases which shouldn't be more then 15 -20 percent.   \n\uf0b7 Every individual is supposed to maintain a repository of the sales pipeline in terms of important follow ups \nbefore or after the meeting  is scheduled, hot and qualified leads. Hound the individuals and get a \nresponse be it with prospects or sales teams. In case a potential prospect has gone dormant, strategize \nwith me and we'll get it to the table.   \nBelow are the relevant sales teams for r espective campaigns.   \nAI/ML \u2013 Dr. Ali and Rashid Z afar \nFlex - Kamran Khalid and Asad J aved   \nCustom app D ev/PS  - Rashid Z afar \nAWS - Furrukh S ohail and Raj   \nPlease be certain that I am looped in, in all your communications with them, lead  assignments/ spec \nsheets /details.  \n \nTimings are  from 4:30 pm to 1 am  following and overlapping EST and UK time respectively.  \nThe star performers in my team i.e. the ones achieving and/or overachieving their weekly and monthly targets in \nmy team would enjoy a relaxed environment and  flexible timings.  \nThey would have liberty to take long breaks or even leave early, opportunity to work from home - having all this \ndiscussed and approved by me.   \nOn the contrary non performers would not be able to enjoy any perks.  \nAbove all, the culture a nd environment of the team and company is of utmost priority any individual found \ninstilling  negativity to the environment  and/or demotivation effecting team productivity would then and there be \nlaid off.   \n \n "
