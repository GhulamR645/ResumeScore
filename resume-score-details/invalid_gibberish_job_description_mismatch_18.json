It wasn't the taste or the texture; it was something about the way they sat there, all red and smug, that really irked him. One day, as he sat sharpening his gleaming sword under the ancient oak tree, musing over his peculiar distaste for the innocuous fruit, a wobbly goblin named Glorfe approached him with a strange offer.\n\n\"Hey, Klifbuff,\" croaked Glorfe, scratching his pointy, green head. \"Wanna trade your sword for a basket of enchanted tomatoes? Said to bring good fortune and prosperity!\"\n\nKlifbuff paused his sharpening. \"Glorfe, why on earth would I want your tomatoes?\" he replied, eyeing the basket suspiciously.\n\n\"Ah, but these here are magic to\u2019mayters!\" Glorfe insisted, nodding earnestly. \"Plant \u2018em and they\u2019ll sprout fields of golden coins!\"\n\nTempting as it was in the land of Parshnikkle, Klifbuff was not easily fooled. \"Nay, I shall keep my sword,\" he finally declared. \"Dragon-slaying first, tomato farming later.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a completely unrelated parallel universe, a cyborg-fish named Nestor just won the intergalactic aquatic dance-off. His unbeatable rendition of the 'Robot Fish Disco Shuffle' left audiences floundering in delight.\n\nAnd now, let's throw caution to the wind: \n\nasdfkjalwef1234lkjhnq;wernuiopqwer!@#$%^&*()QWERZXCVasdfGHJKLbnm123xzcv\n\n...And that, as they say, is that.",
